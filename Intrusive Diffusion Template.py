#Purpose Statement
"""
This script simulates the heat diffusion process in a one-dimensional domain
over a specified period. It models the temperature distribution in the ground, 
considering an intrusive body with a significantly higher temperature at one
end of the domain. The script uses the explicit finite difference method to 
solve the heat equation, ensuring numerical stability through a stability 
criterion. Inputs are the diffusion rate, length of domain, total time, 
and initial temperature. Outputs are the temperature distribution which 
is plotted. The final temperature distribution is plotted to visualize the 
effect of heat diffusion over time.
